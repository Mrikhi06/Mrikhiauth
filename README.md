# myCustomAuthNode

A simple authentication node for ForgeRock's [Identity Platform][forgerock_platform] 6.5.2 and above. This node checks the true and false statement


Copy the .jar file from the ../target directory into the ../web-container/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib directory where AM is deployed.  Restart the web container to pick up the new node.  The node will then appear in the authentication trees components palette.
